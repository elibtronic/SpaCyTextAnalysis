The [on_match documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/rule-based-matching#on_match) demonstrates some interesting use-cases for this feature, including marking bad html tags for removal, or implementing a basic sentiment analyzer or automatically adding additional attribute information to matched spans.    \n",
